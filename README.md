# Fraction & FractionRunner

Fraction is a class which represents rational numbers as objects in C++. Instances of 
Fraction may be 

 - reduced via the simplify() method,
 - added,
 - subtracted,
 - multiplied,
 - divided,
 - compared through the use of equality and inequality operators, and
 - input from or output to the console in fractional form.
 
Furthermore, every arithmetic operation calls the simplify method in order to output 
the reduced result of the operation.

FractionRunner is a test program which demonstrates the functionality of Fraction.
